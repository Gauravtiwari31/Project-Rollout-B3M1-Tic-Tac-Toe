# Project-Rollout-B3M1-Tic-Tac-Toe
**Description:**

Develop a Tic Tac Toe game for two players with an interactive console interface. Optionally, use file handling to save the game state and allow players to resume.

**File Handling Requirements (Optional):**

1. **Game State File (`game_state.txt`):**
    - Store the current board state and the playerâ€™s turn.
    Example:
        
        ```
        X,O,X
        -,O,-
        X,-,-
        Player Turn: 2
        
        ```
        

**Console Flow Example:**

1. **Starting a New Game:**
    
    ```
    Welcome to Tic Tac Toe!
    Player 1: X
    Player 2: O
    
    ```
    
2. **Game Board:**
    
    ```
    Current Board:
     1 | 2 | 3
    ---+---+---
     4 | X | 6
    ---+---+---
     7 | 8 | 9
    
    Player 2, enter your move (1-9): 7
    
    ```
    
3. **Saving Game State:**
    
    ```
    Game state saved!
    (Current board and player turn recorded in game_state.txt)
    
    ```
    

**Note:**

- The design above is **just a template**. Feel free to add features like move validation or advanced AI for single-player mode.
